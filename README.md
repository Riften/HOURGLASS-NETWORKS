# HOURGLASS-NETWORKS
A model trained by hourglass networks. See details at here: http://www-personal.umich.edu/~alnewell/pose/

The train and validation data can be download from here:https://pan.baidu.com/s/1o8dimWq
Once you have downloaded these data, please put them in a file renamed as "dataset". And put that file in where the code is.
These data is shared by Chenxi Wang. I would like to thank him for his contribution of data processing here. I have to see that the most difficult part of using this model is how to solve the dataset. I will add the processing details of data later.
